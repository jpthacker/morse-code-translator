# Morse Code Translator

A web-based programme made using an OOP approach that converts English to Morse Code and back again based on user input. It includes two classes, an English -> Morse Code translator class and a Morse Code -> English translator class, which, when fed a library of equivalent alphabets, include all the information and methods necessary for translating between the two alphabets.

The translator is case insensitive, thus “sos” should produce same output as “SOS” (“••• −−− •••”). When translating Morse Code to English, the output is uppercased, thus “••• −−− •••” translated into English outputs “SOS”.

## Technologies & Features:

- Vanilla JavaScript
- OOP approach
- Unit Tested using Jest
- HTML5
- CSS/SCSS
- Mobile first / responsive design
- Git Version Control

## Further Developments:

- Add option to change input language (i.e. French, Spanish, etc.)
- Alternatively, enable the input to be in any lnaguage (i.e. include multiple languages in the alphabet library)
